Notes:
- Ensure that the application is installed and running in the background as a startup process for automatic monitoring.
- The application is designed to have minimal CPU consumption.
- CPU usage is logged every 2 minutes in a log file.
- After the backup operation completes, a log file is created on the destination USB drive specifying the total size of files backed up and the CPU time consumed.
